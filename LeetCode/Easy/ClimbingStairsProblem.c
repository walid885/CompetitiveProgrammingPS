/*
the problem is about climbing the stairs, we have too options, we can go either one step or 2 steps at a time. 
there are basically two cases, if the number is even or odd. 
even : exemple 4 
we can have 1 + 1 +1 +1 
            2 +1 +1 
            2 +2 
an other even number 
        6 : 1+1+ ... + 1 
            2+1+1+1+1
            2+2+1+1
            2+2+2
so , basically we are trying to decompose that number into a sequance of one and twwos
